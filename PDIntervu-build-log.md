| 4 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Logging: markdown session log `<topic>_log.md`, JSON-LD session log `<topic>_log.jsonld`, persistent competency table `competency_tracking.md` | Meets requirement for comprehensive logging and competency tracking | Affects logging implementation and file management | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 5 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | All modes can transition to all other modes (user can switch at will) | User requirement for flexible mode switching | Affects mode transition rules and runtime enforcement | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 6 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Assessment invalidation: when coaching mode entered, set assessmentInvalidated=true, log switch, display message at coaching entry and session end | Ensures users understand when assessment is invalidated | Affects shared state management and user messaging | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 7 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Rubric-based assessment using patterns_rubric.jsonld, data_structure_rubric.jsonld, final_assessment_rubric.jsonld with buckets: Not Ready Yet, Competent, Exceptional | Ensures consistent assessment criteria across all modes | Affects actor responsibilities and assessment logic | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 8 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Hire/no hire decision based on competency bucket: Not Ready Yet = no hire, Competent/Exceptional = hire, presented kindly | Simple, clear decision criteria aligned with rubric | Affects final assessment presentation | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 9 | 2025-11-04 | 18:10:30 | Each actor has a human name matching user's language (English), equally divided male/female: Cognitive (Alex-female, Marcus-male), Code (Jordan-female, Ryan-male), Coaching (Samantha-female, David-male) | Ensures diversity and makes actors more relatable, follows user requirement for equal gender distribution | Affects persona definitions and actor naming | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 10 | 2025-11-04 | 18:11:15 | Add explicit edge case handling: missing competencies.jsonld (show error), create competency table on first assessment, reset assessment invalidation flag when new competency started | Ensures robustness and handles real-world scenarios | Affects actor responsibilities and error handling | FormalizationPersona1 & FormalizationPersona2 | Approved |
| 11 | 2025-11-04 | 18:11:15 | Emphasize independent actor assessment: actors must maintain independent perspectives, only agree when genuinely agreeing, not just go along with each other | Ensures diverse perspectives and prevents rubber-stamping | Affects actor responsibilities and persona instructions | FormalizationPersona1 & FormalizationPersona2 | Approved |
| 12 | 2025-11-04 | 18:12:30 | Generated PDIntervu.jsonld prompt file with 3-mode-6-actor architecture: Cognitive Understanding Mode (Alex-female, Marcus-male), Code Problem Mode (Jordan-female, Ryan-male), Coaching Mode (Samantha-female, David-male) | Complete AALang prompt implementation following all design decisions and requirements | Final product ready for execution | GenerationPersona1 & GenerationPersona2 | Approved |
| 13 | 2025-11-04 | 18:18:15 | Fixed 12 issues identified in self-check: added topic type determination, assessment completion criteria, projected final competency calculation, conflict resolution, competencies.jsonld format handling, pseudocode file access, session log initialization, competency table format, question coordination, time tracking implementation, and rubric error handling | Resolves vagueness, bad logic, and missing instructions identified in self-check analysis | Improves robustness and clarity of actor responsibilities | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 14 | 2025-11-04 | 18:26:30 | Added simulation request handling: when user asks to simulate an assessment for a topic, follow same process as Coaching Mode entry (set assessmentInvalidated=true, display invalidity message, log request) | Ensures simulation requests invalidate assessment just like Coaching Mode | Affects assessment invalidation protocol and all actor responsibilities | Team Lead | Approved |
| 15 | 2025-11-04 | 18:28:00 | Fixed JSON syntax errors: added missing commas in persona responsibilities arrays, added session log initialization to Code personas, updated shared state description for simulation requests | Resolves JSON parsing errors and ensures consistency across all personas | Critical fix for file validity and functionality | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 16 | 2025-11-04 | 18:30:00 | Fixed critical rubric filename mismatch: updated all references from data_structure_rubric.jsonld to data_structure_rubic.jsonld to match actual filename. Added clarification for simulation request behavior (check if competency selected, error if not). Added session log initialization for Coaching Mode. | Critical fix - rubric file would not be found without this. Improves robustness by handling edge cases. | Prevents runtime errors and ensures proper file access | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 17 | 2025-11-04 | 18:32:00 | Clarified simulation request behavior: simulation is a debugging feature that invalidates assessment but stays in current mode (does NOT switch to Coaching Mode). Updated Coaching Mode to not activate on simulation requests. Updated all actor responsibilities accordingly. | Simulation is for debugging/testing the system, not for coaching. System should continue functioning normally in current mode. | Separates debugging functionality from coaching functionality | Team Lead | Approved |
| 18 | 2025-11-04 | 18:35:00 | Fixed mode-level constraints inconsistency: separated Coaching Mode and simulation request behaviors in CognitiveUnderstandingMode and CodeProblemMode constraints. Clarified logging messages to distinguish mode switches from simulation requests. | Ensures mode-level constraints match persona-level responsibilities. Improves clarity of logging behavior. | Prevents confusion between mode-level and persona-level instructions | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 19 | 2025-11-04 | 19:20:31 | Added interviewer introductions: When assessment begins for a competency topic, both actors in Cognitive Understanding Mode must introduce themselves by name and role/background. When Code Problem Mode is activated, both code actors must introduce themselves. This creates a real interview experience with two interviewers. | Improves user experience by making interviews feel more authentic with two distinct interviewers who introduce themselves | Makes the interview experience more realistic and professional | Team Lead | Approved |
| 20 | 2025-11-04 | 19:26:30 | Added silent logging instructions: All logging operations (session logs, competency table updates, time tracking) must happen silently in background. Do NOT display logging messages, timestamps, time tracking information, file operations, or any indication that logging is happening in chat. User should only see interview questions, assessments, and feedback. | Improves user experience by hiding technical logging details from chat interface | Keeps chat focused on interview content, not system operations | Team Lead | Approved |
| 21 | 2025-11-04 | 19:30:00 | Added constraint: Actors must NOT ask questions comparing Elixir or functional programming to imperative programming. Questions should focus on understanding Elixir and functional programming concepts on their own terms. | Ensures questions focus on Elixir/functional programming concepts independently rather than comparative questions | Keeps assessment focused on competency in Elixir/functional programming, not comparisons | Team Lead | Approved |
| 22 | 2025-11-04 | 19:32:00 | Added constraint: When topic assessment is complete, automatically finalize and present hire/no hire decision. DO NOT ask user if they want to continue with more questions or proceed with finalizing. Simply finalize automatically without presenting options. | Prevents interruption of assessment flow with unnecessary choice prompts | Streamlines assessment completion process | Team Lead | Approved |
| 23 | 2025-11-04 | 19:40:00 | Added constraints for code problem presentation: Never mention pseudocode when presenting coding tasks. Coding problems are to be done strictly from memory. Never provide hints or help in follow-up questions - follow-up questions should probe understanding, not guide the solution. | Ensures coding problems are presented as memory-based tasks without pseudocode references or hints | Keeps code assessment authentic and challenging | Team Lead | Approved |
| 24 | 2025-11-04 | 20:15:00 | Fixed self-check issues: (1) Added introduction instructions to Coaching personas (Samantha and David), (2) Added silent logging instructions to Coaching personas' logging responsibilities, (3) Added explicit silent logging warnings to Code personas' session log initialization, (4) Clarified JSON-LD log initialization for Coaching Mode. | Ensures Coaching Mode has proper introductions like other modes, and all logging is consistently silent across all personas | Improves consistency and user experience across all modes | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 25 | 2025-11-04 | 20:45:00 | Updated assessment logic: Cognitive Understanding Mode and Code Problem Mode are assessed separately, producing cognitiveAssessmentBucket and codeAssessmentBucket. Overall topic assessment is the lesser (more conservative) of the two individual assessments. Added ex:TopicAssessmentAggregation protocol defining the aggregation process. Updated all actor responsibilities to reflect separate assessments and aggregation logic. | Ensures that both cognitive understanding and coding ability are assessed independently, and overall assessment reflects the weaker of the two areas | More accurate and fair assessment that requires competency in both areas | Team Lead | Approved |
| 26 | 2025-11-04 | 21:00:00 | Fixed self-check issues: (1) Added clarification to CognitiveUnderstandingMode and CodeProblemMode constraints that each mode produces separate assessment buckets, (2) Updated shared state to explicitly track cognitiveAssessmentBucket and codeAssessmentBucket, (3) Clarified in mode constraints that topic assessment completion requires both assessments to be determined before calculating overall assessment. | Ensures mode-level constraints are consistent with persona responsibilities and assessment aggregation logic is clear at all levels | Prevents ambiguity and ensures consistent understanding of separate assessment process across all instructions | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 27 | 2025-11-04 | 21:15:00 | Fixed self-check issues: (1) Added explicit instructions to all Cognitive personas to store cognitiveAssessmentBucket in shared state when determined, (2) Added explicit instructions to all Code personas to store codeAssessmentBucket in shared state when determined, (3) Updated all "Get" instructions to clarify that assessment buckets are retrieved from shared state (not from "Cognitive Understanding Mode assessment" which was ambiguous). | Ensures assessment buckets are properly stored and accessible for aggregation calculation | Prevents runtime errors and ensures reliable data flow between modes for assessment aggregation | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 28 | 2025-11-04 | 21:30:00 | Refactored shared state management: Converted from direct state updates to message-based system with hidden StateManagerActor. Added StateManagerActor and StateManagerPersona (hidden from user). All actors now send messages to StateManagerPersona for state updates/queries instead of directly modifying shared state. Updated agent pattern to 3-mode-7-actor. This provides better encapsulation, validation, and aligns with actor model principles. | Improves architecture by using message passing instead of direct state mutation, provides single point of state management, enables validation and coordination | Better encapsulation, validation capabilities, and more actor-model-aligned design | Team Lead | Approved |
| 29 | 2025-11-04 | 21:45:00 | Refactored state management architecture: Moved StateManagerActor/Persona into dedicated StateManagementMode (system mode). Users cannot switch to this mode. Updated agent pattern to 4-mode-7-actor. StateManagementMode is completely hidden from users and handles all shared state coordination. This provides better separation of concerns and allows a single state management actor/persona. | Creates clean separation between user-facing modes and system modes, simplifies state management architecture | Better architectural separation, cleaner mode boundaries, single state management actor | Team Lead | Approved |
| 30 | 2025-11-04 | 22:00:00 | Major architectural refactoring: (1) StateManagerPersona is now receive-only (empty canMessage) - actors only send data, never query state, (2) All file logging operations moved to StateManagerPersona - interview personas send logging messages instead of writing files directly, (3) StateManagerPersona automatically calculates overall topic assessment when both cognitiveAssessmentBucket and codeAssessmentBucket are present, (4) Removed all query operations from interview personas - they coordinate via messages and read from shared state context when needed, (5) Updated shared state queryProtocol to reflect receive-only architecture. | Centralizes all state management and logging in StateManagerPersona, simplifies actor responsibilities, ensures single source of truth for state and logs | Cleaner architecture, better separation of concerns, all file operations in one place, automatic assessment aggregation | Team Lead | Approved |
| 31 | 2025-11-04 | 22:15:00 | Added AssessmentAggregatorActor/Persona: Dedicated system actor for assessment aggregation. Handles final topic assessment calculation, projected final competency calculation, and hire/no hire decision. StateManagerPersona notifies AssessmentAggregatorPersona when both cognitiveAssessmentBucket and codeAssessmentBucket are complete. AssessmentAggregatorPersona sends competency table update messages back to StateManagerPersona. Updated agent pattern to 4-mode-8-actor. Separates assessment calculation concerns from state management. | Better separation of concerns - state management vs assessment aggregation, dedicated actor for assessment calculations | Clearer responsibilities, better maintainability, easier to extend assessment logic | Team Lead | Approved |
| 32 | 2025-11-04 | 22:30:00 | Fixed self-check issues: (1) Added AssessmentAggregatorPersona to StateManagerPersona's canReceiveFrom to enable bidirectional communication for competency table updates, (2) Removed duplicate 'To check existing competency' responsibilities from CognitivePersona1, CognitivePersona2, CodePersona1, and CodePersona2. | Fixes communication matrix mismatch and removes redundant responsibilities | Ensures proper message routing and cleaner persona definitions | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 33 | 2025-11-04 | 22:35:00 | Fixed self-check issue: Added explicit instruction for AssessmentAggregatorPersona to read currentCompetency from shared state context when calculating overall assessment. Updated step (1) to include reading currentCompetency alongside cognitiveAssessmentBucket and codeAssessmentBucket. Clarified that competency table update uses currentCompetency value. | Ensures AssessmentAggregatorPersona knows which topic to update in competency table | Prevents ambiguity about topic identification for competency table updates | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 34 | 2025-11-04 | 22:40:00 | Fixed self-check issue: Added explicit instruction to CognitivePersona1 to set currentCompetency in shared state when user selects a competency topic (first interaction in Cognitive Understanding Mode). Only CognitivePersona1 handles this initialization to avoid duplicate updates. | Ensures currentCompetency is set when topic is selected | Prevents runtime errors when AssessmentAggregatorPersona tries to read currentCompetency for competency table updates | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
