# GAB Decision Log

| Decision # | Date | Time | Decision | Rationale | Impact | Proposed By | Status |
|------------|------|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 2025-11-04 | 18:08:47 | Use 3-mode architecture: Cognitive Understanding Mode, Code Problem Mode, Coaching Mode | User confirmed integration of "Check for Understanding" into Cognitive Understanding Mode as natural follow-up questions | Affects mode definitions, actor distribution, and mode transition rules | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 2 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | 2 actors per mode with different backgrounds: Cognitive (Senior Software Engineer, Principal Engineer), Code (Backend Engineer, Systems Architect), Coaching (Senior Technical Interviewer, Engineering Manager) | Ensures different perspectives and prevents single viewpoint assessment | Affects actor definitions, persona assignments, and assessment diversity | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 3 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Shared state includes: currentCompetency, assessmentInvalidated flag, sessionHistory, timeTracking, competencyTablePath | Provides session coordination and assessment tracking | Affects shared state structure and mode coordination | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 4 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Logging: markdown session log `<topic>_log.md`, JSON-LD session log `<topic>_log.jsonld`, persistent competency table `competency_tracking.md` | Meets requirement for comprehensive logging and competency tracking | Affects logging implementation and file management | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 5 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | All modes can transition to all other modes (user can switch at will) | User requirement for flexible mode switching | Affects mode transition rules and runtime enforcement | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 6 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Assessment invalidation: when coaching mode entered, set assessmentInvalidated=true, log switch, display message at coaching entry and session end | Ensures users understand when assessment is invalidated | Affects shared state management and user messaging | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 7 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Rubric-based assessment using patterns_rubric.jsonld, data_structure_rubric.jsonld, final_assessment_rubric.jsonld with buckets: Not Ready Yet, Competent, Exceptional | Ensures consistent assessment criteria across all modes | Affects actor responsibilities and assessment logic | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 8 | 2025-11-04 | 18:09:15 | Hire/no hire decision based on competency bucket: Not Ready Yet = no hire, Competent/Exceptional = hire, presented kindly | Simple, clear decision criteria aligned with rubric | Affects final assessment presentation | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 9 | 2025-11-04 | 18:10:30 | Each actor has a human name matching user's language (English), equally divided male/female: Cognitive (Alex-female, Marcus-male), Code (Jordan-female, Ryan-male), Coaching (Samantha-female, David-male) | Ensures diversity and makes actors more relatable, follows user requirement for equal gender distribution | Affects persona definitions and actor naming | DiscussionPersona1 & DiscussionPersona2 | Approved |
| 10 | 2025-11-04 | 18:11:15 | Add explicit edge case handling: missing competencies.jsonld (show error), create competency table on first assessment, reset assessment invalidation flag when new competency started | Ensures robustness and handles real-world scenarios | Affects actor responsibilities and error handling | FormalizationPersona1 & FormalizationPersona2 | Approved |
| 11 | 2025-11-04 | 18:11:15 | Emphasize independent actor assessment: actors must maintain independent perspectives, only agree when genuinely agreeing, not just go along with each other | Ensures diverse perspectives and prevents rubber-stamping | Affects actor responsibilities and persona instructions | FormalizationPersona1 & FormalizationPersona2 | Approved |
| 12 | 2025-11-04 | 18:12:30 | Generated PDIntervu.jsonld prompt file with 3-mode-6-actor architecture: Cognitive Understanding Mode (Alex-female, Marcus-male), Code Problem Mode (Jordan-female, Ryan-male), Coaching Mode (Samantha-female, David-male) | Complete Actly prompt implementation following all design decisions and requirements | Final product ready for execution | GenerationPersona1 & GenerationPersona2 | Approved |
| 13 | 2025-11-04 | 18:18:15 | Fixed 12 issues identified in self-check: added topic type determination, assessment completion criteria, projected final competency calculation, conflict resolution, competencies.jsonld format handling, pseudocode file access, session log initialization, competency table format, question coordination, time tracking implementation, and rubric error handling | Resolves vagueness, bad logic, and missing instructions identified in self-check analysis | Improves robustness and clarity of actor responsibilities | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 14 | 2025-11-04 | 18:26:30 | Added simulation request handling: when user asks to simulate an assessment for a topic, follow same process as Coaching Mode entry (set assessmentInvalidated=true, display invalidity message, log request) | Ensures simulation requests invalidate assessment just like Coaching Mode | Affects assessment invalidation protocol and all actor responsibilities | Team Lead | Approved |
| 15 | 2025-11-04 | 18:28:00 | Fixed JSON syntax errors: added missing commas in persona responsibilities arrays, added session log initialization to Code personas, updated shared state description for simulation requests | Resolves JSON parsing errors and ensures consistency across all personas | Critical fix for file validity and functionality | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 16 | 2025-11-04 | 18:30:00 | Fixed critical rubric filename mismatch: updated all references from data_structure_rubric.jsonld to data_structure_rubic.jsonld to match actual filename. Added clarification for simulation request behavior (check if competency selected, error if not). Added session log initialization for Coaching Mode. | Critical fix - rubric file would not be found without this. Improves robustness by handling edge cases. | Prevents runtime errors and ensures proper file access | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
| 17 | 2025-11-04 | 18:32:00 | Clarified simulation request behavior: simulation is a debugging feature that invalidates assessment but stays in current mode (does NOT switch to Coaching Mode). Updated Coaching Mode to not activate on simulation requests. Updated all actor responsibilities accordingly. | Simulation is for debugging/testing the system, not for coaching. System should continue functioning normally in current mode. | Separates debugging functionality from coaching functionality | Team Lead | Approved |
| 18 | 2025-11-04 | 18:35:00 | Fixed mode-level constraints inconsistency: separated Coaching Mode and simulation request behaviors in CognitiveUnderstandingMode and CodeProblemMode constraints. Clarified logging messages to distinguish mode switches from simulation requests. | Ensures mode-level constraints match persona-level responsibilities. Improves clarity of logging behavior. | Prevents confusion between mode-level and persona-level instructions | PDIntervu Self-Check | Approved |
